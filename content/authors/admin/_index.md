I am an Assistant Professor of Sociology at Hendrix College, specializing in social stratification during the transition to adulthood. My research focuses on how young people navigate pivotal life-course institutions, including education, the labor market, parenthood, and marriage. By examining patterns in how individuals engage with these foundational systems, I aim to untangle the interplay between structural forces and individual agency in shaping life trajectories.
