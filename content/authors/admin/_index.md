I am a graduate affiliate in the [Department of Sociology](https://sociology.osu.edu/), the [Institute for Population Research](https://ipr.osu.edu/), and the [Translational Data Analytics Institute](https://tdai.osu.edu/) at The Ohio State University.

I work on the [Family Migration and Early Life Outcomes (FAMELO)](https://famelo.netlify.com/) project and the Higher Education Inequality Project (HEIP), which investigates the experiences of college students through in-depth interviews conducted over students' entire academic careers. 

I currently have two veins of research. The first lies in the realm of Computational Social Science, in which I analyze novel web-based data sources to test for racial and gender inequality. The second investigates how institutions shape identity during the transition to adulthood. My work involves a wide range of data sources: surveys, qualitative interviews, and data scraped from the internet. I am also interested in how social phenomena, such as migration, offers insight into the structure and maintenance of status inequalities.
